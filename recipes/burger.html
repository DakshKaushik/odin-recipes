    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A grilled beef patty on a bun is called a burger. Lunch at a fast food restaurant often consists of a burger and fries. You can use the word burger as a casual shorthand for hamburger, which is ground or minced beef that's fried and served on a bun.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>4 tbsp plain flour</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>40g fine dried breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>finely grated to make 1 tbsp parmesan</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 burger buns or floury baps</li>
        <li>lemon wedges, to serve</li>
        <li>shredded iceberg lettuce, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Butterfly the chicken breasts, then bash between two pieces of baking paper until about 5mm thick, then season both sides. Put the flour and egg into separate shallow bowls, and mix the breadcrumbs with the parmesan in a third bowl. Dust the chicken in the flour, dip in the egg then coat in the cheesy breadcrumbs.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium-high heat, and fry the schnitzels for 3-4 minutes on each side or until golden, crisp and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Combine the slaw ingredients in a large bowl, and season. Split and toast the buns. Squeeze a little lemon juice over the schnitzels, then cut each in two pieces. Serve in the buns with the lettuce and slaw, with any remaining slaw alongside.</li>
    </ol>
